title: free breezes and universes
tags: philosophy, metanoia, leetcraft

All the breezes that need physical or concrete objects like musical videoclips
are subject to the limitations of any other universes. I mean, they are
universes like any other, their metareality only change to "high" or "low" by
the characteristic of karma, merit or lack of merit.

So, I say, if you are devouting your time in creating transshifting
metarealities, try as you can to avoid concrete objects (what was already
created by others) in its idealizations and affirmation (or foundation), as
they tend to imprision the conscience -and so, the inherent power- in creating
freely.
