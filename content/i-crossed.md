title: I Crossed to the Other Margin
tags: diary

I have crossed to the other margin. After many time of practice, the teaching
of masters, except for the Supreme Master of Mine have no more meaning to me.

The objective has been attained. I have no more flutuations.

I believe this is the begin of the Path. But I have no doubt that is the
crossing of the margin.
