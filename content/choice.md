“Choice” is *potential*. Choice *x* or choice *y* is putting that potential at
an end.

A man studies a musical instrument for a while, then he says: “Ok, now, I am a
musician.” But if now he is a musician what was he before? nothing? void? He
was something, because we remember he was. Maybe he were that potential that
when confined, is no potential anymore.
