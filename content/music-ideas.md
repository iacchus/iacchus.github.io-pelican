## Greek Modes

We were thinking about greek modes these days.

```
intervals  P1 m2 M2 m3 M3 P4 TT P5 m6 M6 m7 M7 P8
semitones  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12
ionian     c     d     e  f     g     a     b  c
dorian     d     e  f     g     a     b  c     d
phrygian   e  f     g     a     b  c     d     e
lydian     f     g     a     b  c     d     e  f
myxolidian g     a     b  c     d     e  f     g
aeolian    a     b  c     d     e  f     g     a
locrian    b  c     d     e  f     g     a     b
```

### Standard

#### Diatonic Scale Shapes

We are currently sketching a standard to represent a diatonic scale shape for
instrument tuned in fifths.


```
ionian:     0110|0110
dorian:     0101|0101
phrygian:   0011|0011
lydian:     0111|0110
myxolidian: 0110|0101
aeolian:    0101|0011
locrian:    0011|1110
```

maybe we use `b` for the base, so we can shift it. Also can use `r` for root, `t` for tonic etc.

We should achieve a standard notation that allows shifting the base tonic seamlessly.

#### Mode Abbreviations

We can use i, d, p, l, m, a, l



### Mnemonics

Giving the ascending major scale degrees with the semitones:

```
PI M2 M3 P4 P5 M6 M7
0  2  4  5  7  9  11
```

#### Formulating mode from major degree

We do this by the ascending major scale degrees:

```
  I  II III  IV   V  VI VII
  I   D   P   L   M  A  L
```

#### Formulating key from enharmonic tonic

We use the Major scale intervals, but in descending order to achieve this.

* I ─ First Degree (C, CM)
* D ─ Descending Second (C, BbM)
* P ─ Descending Major Third (C, AbM)
* L ─ Descending Perfect Fourth (C, GM)
* M ─ Descending Perfect Fifth (C, FM)
* A ─ Descending Major Sixth (C, EbM)
* L ─ Descending Major Seventh (C, C#M)
