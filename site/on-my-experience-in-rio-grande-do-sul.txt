title: On my experience in Rio Grande do Sul
tags: contemplation, philosophy

I was thinking about my xperience in Rio Grande do Sul, it's deeply rooted tradition, the people behaviour here.

Also, the culture of drinking the Chimarr√£o (traditional beverage made of *yerba mate*)

It seems to me very significant to my life and human experience having arrived and lived here for these years.
