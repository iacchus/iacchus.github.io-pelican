title: Philosophy and agendas
tags: philosophy, metanoia

Me, as a philosopher, cannot have any compromise with any agenda. As agendas are forms of
viewing the life from a perspective, and a philosopher should look into the
"human" life from a free "perspective".

Nothing ever was so funny as tagging this post.
