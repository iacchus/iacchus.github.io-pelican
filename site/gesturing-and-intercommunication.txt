title: Gesturing and Intercommunication
tags: tpw, philosophy

In the reality, in the intercommunication between people (eg., strange people
you meet on street) is only symbolic. The main action is in the consciousness
trying to understand the meaning of those symbolic acts and gestures. No need
to rush over other people when meeting then. Just get in touch and express your
will.
